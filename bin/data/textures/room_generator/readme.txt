Just add new texture to any folder you wish and it will appear in a room in the game.

=============
Walls
=============
Size: 8x8

For walls you have to define two textures: horizontal and vertical. They MUST have the same name (wallName), 
but located in different folders (walls_vertical and walls_horizontal). For best result, wall texture have to
be tileable in at least one direction.

=============
Decorations
=============
Size: type defined (you can rely on existing images)

If you want to add a new decoration, you have to create it with one of standard names: i.e. vase_other_text -
will add new vase - as you can see, 'vase_' - is mandatory part of decoration name that defines type of decoration,
'other_text' - can be what you want.

All file names should be in ANSI char set. No unicode symbols are allowed!
