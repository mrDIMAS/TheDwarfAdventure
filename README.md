## How to build

First of all you need C++17 compiler. I'm using GCC 8.2 on Linux and Visual Studio 2015 (with std::experimental) on Windows.

### Dependencies
Game depends on SFML and GLEW libraries.

### Windows
Use `projects/DwarfDig.sln` on Visual Studio 2015 or higher.

### Linux 
I'm using CodeLite IDE, but you can use generated makefile from `codeliteproj`

### Mac
Unfortunately I didn't tested game on Mac and never build it for Mac. But you can try.
